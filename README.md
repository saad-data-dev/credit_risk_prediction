# Credit Risk Prediction

## 🎯 Project Overview

Credit Risk Prediction is a machine-learning project that predicts whether a credit card client will default on their payment next month. The project uses demographic data, credit history, payment behavior, and financial information to build predictive models identifying high-risk clients.

This repository includes the full data science pipeline: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, interpretation, and a simple interactive Streamlit application for testing predictions.

## 🧰 Requirements

To run this project, you need:

* **Python 3.8+**

* Core libraries:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` — data manipulation & numerical operations
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — visualization & plotting
  * `scikit-learn` — preprocessing, model training & evaluation
  * `joblib` — saving/loading trained models
  * `streamlit` — interactive web application

* Optional / recommended:

  * `jupyter` — interactive notebooks
  * `imbalanced-learn` — handling class imbalance (SMOTE, undersampling)
  * `xgboost`, `lightgbm` — advanced boosting models

* Dataset: `default of credit card clients.csv` (CSV with `;` separator) containing financial, demographic, payment history, and target variable `default payment next month`.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib streamlit
# optionally
pip install imbalanced-learn xgboost lightgbm jupyter
```

## 🚀 Workflow / Project Steps

1. **Import required libraries**
2. **Load dataset** — read CSV and preview data
3. **Data cleaning & preprocessing**

   * Remove duplicate headers or incorrect rows
   * Rename columns
   * Convert values to numeric and handle missing/invalid values
   * Clip out-of-range values (ages, payment history, amounts)
   * Drop irrelevant columns (e.g., `ID`)
   * Remove duplicates
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Statistical summary, distribution plots, correlation heatmap
   * Analyze target variable distribution
5. **Feature engineering & data preparation**

   * Separate features (`X`) and target (`y`)
   * Train/test split with stratification
   * Scale numerical features
   * Optionally engineer new features (interactions, aggregated scores, consistency)
6. **Model training**

   * Baseline model: Logistic Regression
   * Optional advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
7. **Evaluation**

   * Compute metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
   * Focus on recall/F1 for default class
8. **Interpretation & insights**

   * Analyze model strengths/weaknesses
   * Identify key features and business implications
9. **Reporting & documentation**

   * Save cleaned data
   * Document findings and limitations in Markdown reports
10. **Interactive application (Streamlit)**

    * Input client data
    * Predict default risk in real-time
    * Display results through a simple interface

---

## 🖥️ Interactive Application (Streamlit)

* **Location:** `api/app.py`
* **Functionality:**

  * Enter client features (age, income, payment history, etc.)
  * Click **Predict** to see predicted credit default risk immediately
* **Usage:**

```bash
# Make sure you are in the project directory
python -m streamlit run api/app.py
```

* **Requirement:** The trained model file `credit_model.pkl` must be in the same folder as `app.py`.

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

* Cleaned dataset ready for analysis
* EDA results including distributions, correlations, and target imbalance checks
* Modeling results with evaluation metrics and confusion matrices
* Detailed Markdown reports summarizing findings and recommendations
* Interactive testing of predictions via Streamlit

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

* Dataset is **imbalanced**, biasing models toward majority class
* Baseline model may have **low recall for default class**, risking missed high-risk clients
* Financial and regulatory constraints require careful interpretation before deployment
* Streamlit app is a **proof-of-concept**, not production-ready

---

## 🔭 Future Work

* Implement resampling or class-weight strategies to address class imbalance
* Train advanced models with hyperparameter tuning
* Engineer additional features (payment trends, ratios, aggregated scores)
* Add explainable AI techniques (SHAP, feature importance)
* Extend dataset for validation and robustness
* Improve Streamlit app: add more client features, better UI, input validation
